# My Machine Learning Journey

This repository is a personal space for me to document my journey into machine learning. It will contain code, notes, and exercises as I learn new concepts and techniques.

## **Goals**

* Understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
* Gain hands-on experience by implementing algorithms from scratch.
* Explore popular machine learning libraries like **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.
* Work on small projects to apply what I've learned.

## **Progress**

I will use this section to track my progress and list the topics I've covered.

* **09/08/2025 - Linear Regression - Single Variable**
* **09/08/2025 - Linear Regression - Multiple Variable**
* **09/08/2025 - Gradient Descent**
* **11/08/2025 - Saving & Loading trained model**
* **11/08/2025 - One Hot Encoding**
