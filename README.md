# My Machine Learning Journey

This repository is a personal space for me to document my journey into machine learning. It will contain code, notes, and exercises as I learn new concepts and techniques.

## **Goals**

* Understand the fundamental concepts of machine learning.
* Gain hands-on experience by implementing algorithms from scratch.
* Explore popular machine learning libraries like **scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.
* Work on small projects to apply what I've learned.
